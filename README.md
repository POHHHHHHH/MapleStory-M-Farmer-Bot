MapleStory M Python Farmer
==========================
This is a simple MapleStory M farmer done using Python. It simply sends keystrokes/ keypresses to MapleStory M.

To set it up, you will need:
* An Android Emulator (i.e. BlueStacks, NOX)
* This set of scripts (main.py, mapleFarmer.py, keypress.py, requirements.txt)
* Python environment
* MapleStory M account

Warning
=======
Using this can get your MapleStory M account banned.

Configurations
==============
Most of the tweaks are found in the variable settings of mapleFarmer.py.

Can it be used for other games?
===============================
I reckon that this set of scripts can be used for other side scrolling games as well.
